                <p>If your child has been diagnosed with PBD-ZSD, your child’s doctor can run a blood test called an
                    atypical bile acid test. Atypical bile acid tests are less common but can give your doctor more
                    information about the health of your child’s liver. High levels of atypical bile acids in your
                    child’s blood serum may indicate potential involvement of the liver.
                    This test program is a
                    partnership between Travere Therapeutics and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.</p>
                <p>If you qualify, this test is available at no cost to you and can be ordered through your child’s
                    doctor. Download the atypical bile acid test form and talk to your child’s doctor about running this
                    important test.</p>
